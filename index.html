									<p>When I was younger, I had a golden retriever named Jackie. He was my best friend and my constant companion. But as life got busier, I couldn’t spend as much time with him. I trusted others to take care of him when I was away, but over time, that care faded. One day, I came home to find Max weak and neglected. The damage was done, and despite trying to save him, I lost him. Jackie passed away because no one was there to care for him when I couldn’t be.</p>

									<p>My friend had a spirited Dalmatian named Sparky, full of life and energy. Sparky loved to run around and needed attention and exercise. But as my friend’s responsibilities grew, Sparky spent more and more time alone. The people left to look after him didn’t give him the love and care he needed. Eventually, his health deteriorated. My friend realized too late, and Sparky passed away. It was a painful reminder that our pets depend on us, and when we can’t be there, they need someone who truly cares.</p>
